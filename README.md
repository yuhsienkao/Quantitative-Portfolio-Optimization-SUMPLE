# Signal Processing for Market Prediction: Adapting Antenna Array Algorithms to High-Frequency Trading

**Project Type:** Lead Internship Project at **Capital Futures Corp., Proprietary Trading Desk** (Top-2 proprietary trading firm in Taiwan).

**Status:** Completed and contributed to the team's internal strategy library.

## 1. Objective & Core Thesis

The core objective of this project was to explore a novel, interdisciplinary approach to quantitative trading by hypothesizing that advanced algorithms used in **antenna array signal processing** could be adapted to financial markets. The goal was to extract tradable signals from noisy, high-frequency data, thereby creating a new source of short-term alpha.

## 2. Methodology & Implementation

The project involved improving and adapting a sophisticated algorithm, traditionally used for analyzing phase drift in antenna arrays, to a completely new domain: high-frequency financial time-series data.

My implementation, developed from scratch in **Python**, focused on two key functions:

* **Waveform Extraction:** The algorithm was engineered to identify and extract statistically significant, **tradable market waveforms** (cycles and transient patterns) that are often obscured by market noise.
* **Noise Suppression:** It was specifically optimized to suppress **microstructure noise**â€”the random, non-informational price fluctuations inherent in high-frequency data.

The ultimate technical achievement was a significant enhancement of the **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** in the target dataset.

***Note: Due to the proprietary nature of the work, the source code for this project cannot be made public. This repository serves as a detailed description of the project's scope, methodology, and impact.***

## 3. Impact & Contribution

* **Alpha Generation:** The resulting model successfully demonstrated the ability to enable **short-term alpha generation** by providing cleaner, more predictive signals.
* **Novel Strategy Contribution:** This unique, cross-domain approach directly contributed a new class of signal processing strategy to the team's core quantitative library.
* **Technical Mastery:** The project showcased the ability to translate a complex academic theory from a hard engineering field (Antenna Theory) into a robust, practical, and profitable application in quantitative finance.
